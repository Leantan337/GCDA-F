GCDA-F Project Progress and Next Steps
====================================

What We've Implemented:
---------------------
1. Model Configuration:
   - Added explicit app_label declarations to models in donations app
   - Fixed Meta class declarations in models.py
   - Moved docstrings to proper positions in model classes

2. App Configuration:
   - Updated apps.py files for both donations and engagement apps
   - Added proper app configurations in INSTALLED_APPS
   - Set up proper app labels and verbose names

3. Database Configuration:
   - Attempted to set up SQLite3 database configuration
   - Added basic database settings in settings.py

Current Issues:
-------------
1. Database Configuration:
   - Still encountering "ImproperlyConfigured" error with database settings
   - Need to resolve the ENGINE configuration issue

2. Model Meta Classes:
   - Still have some lint warnings about Meta class declarations
   - Need to resolve the duplicate Meta class definitions

Next Steps:
----------
1. Fix Database Configuration:
   - Try different approaches to database configuration
   - Consider using environment variables for database settings
   - Make sure BASE_DIR is properly configured
   - Verify database file permissions

2. Model Cleanup:
   - Resolve remaining Meta class issues in models.py
   - Ensure all model relationships are properly defined
   - Add any missing model validations

3. Test Setup:
   - Set up proper test configuration
   - Create test database settings
   - Write comprehensive tests for models and views
   - Set up test fixtures if needed

4. Migration Management:
   - Once database configuration is fixed, run migrations
   - Create new migrations if needed
   - Test migration rollback capabilities

Where to Pick Up:
---------------
1. Start with fixing the database configuration in settings.py:
   - Try using absolute paths for SQLite database
   - Verify Django database backend installation
   - Check for any conflicting database settings

2. Then move on to:
   - Resolving remaining model issues
   - Setting up test environment
   - Running and fixing tests

Priority Tasks:
-------------
1. Fix database configuration (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. Resolve model Meta class issues
3. Set up proper test environment
4. Create and run migrations
5. Write and run tests
